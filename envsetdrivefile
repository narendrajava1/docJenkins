Open a terminal
Open “profile” file using following command: sudo gedit /etc/profile
Find the java path in /usr/lib/jvm. If it’s JDK 7 the java path would be something similar to /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
Insert the following lines at the end of the “profile” file
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export JAVA_HOME
export PATH
Save and close the file.
Type the following command: source /etc/environment
You may have to restart the system
Check whether JAVA_HOME is properly set with following command: echo $JAVA_HOME. If it’s properly set, /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle would be displayed on the terminal.
